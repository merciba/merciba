Merciba
=======

This is the repository for [Merciba](https://merciba.com)'s website.

It was built using React, entirely in ES6. It uses [Paquet](https://github.com/merciba/paquet) as a webserver. 

Since all of the content is static and there is no need for a database, there is no Redux. All style changes and animations are handled directly using either React state or jQuery. Don't fix what ain't broke. 

Webpack and Grunt do the builds, and BrowserSync is used during development for refreshing and simplified cross-device testing.
